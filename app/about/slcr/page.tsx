                    SLCR is more than a laboratory; it is an ecosystem of learning, engagement, co-creation, and experimentation in the real environment. SLCR consists of two major components:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Hybrid Lab (Virtual + Secretariat):</strong> Provides the platform to bring all Govt. Dept., Stakeholders, Academician, Industries and Community to engage to evaluate the Global sustainable solutions (technologies, Policies, frameworks) and enable their implementation in local context through Engagement, Learning and Co-creation. The Hybrid lab will also enable the upscaling of the solutions to the basin level and other rivers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The second component consists of the <strong>On-field Living Lab</strong> having the real field area as an experimental site and is used to demonstrate the co-creation on the field.
